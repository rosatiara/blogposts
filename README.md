### Resolving git merge conflicts

1. Go to your project's directory
    ```bash
    cd <your_project>
    ```
2. Check if there's any unstaged or uncommited changes in your local branch

    ```bash
    git status
    ```

    - If there are untracked/unstaged changes, execute `git add` and commit the changes with `git commit`
    - If there aren't any, go to step 3.

3. Pull latest changes from the remote branch to see conflicting files

    ```bash
    git pull origin master
    ```

4. Add or stage your changes

    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

5. Commit your changes

    ```bash
    git commit -m "resolved merge conflicts"
    ```
